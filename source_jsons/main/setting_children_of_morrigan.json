				"You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.",

On a hit, this weapon impales the creature and opens thirty barbs, making it very difficult to remove. While impaled, a creature takes {@dice 2d6} piercing damage for every 10 feet it travels. When used in this way, the G치e Bulg cannot be used for this type of attack again until the next dawn.",
				"The G치e Bulg can be removed from an impaled creature, or its corpse, with either a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) or Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action. On a fail, the creature takes {@dice 4d6} piercing damage and the creature is still impaled. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and the G치e Bulg is removed."
