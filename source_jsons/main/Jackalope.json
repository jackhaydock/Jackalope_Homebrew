The simplest versions of these masks are static and provide little more than a form of visual identity and a place to look when conversing. Some wispers take to carrying multiple masks to non-verbally communicate multiple emotions. Others might acquire more elaborate mechanical or magical masks capable of more animated expression. Some decorate their mask with patterns as a form of artistic or cultural expression, in a similar manner to hairstyles or tattoos. For similar reasons, wispers may even employ prostetic hands and limbs, allowing them to gesture, even when such limbs lack functionality.

For example, a creature falling in a low gravity environment might only fall 30 feet on the first turn and then only 250 feet each subsequent turn. They might also simply fall 30 feet on every turn, never accelerating beyond that. If the falling rate is sufficiently changed, consider treating creatures as if they were one or more sizes larger or smaller, as per the Variant Fall Damage rules.",
										"{@b Grab On.} At the DM's discretion, if a falling creature passes a suitable ledge, rope or handhold to slow or stop their fall, they can use a reaction to attempt to grab it. The creature makes a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature stops falling and takes half of the falling damage they would have at that point in their fall. The DM might decide that only player characters can make such heroic and difficult grabs, while most creatures simply fall.",
										"{@b Sky Diver.} Once per turn, while falling, a creature can use an action to dive or slow their fall. They fall fall twice or half as far at the end of the current turn.",
										"{@b Weightless Disorientation.} While falling, a creature is disorientated by the weightless feeling and has disadvantage on melee attacks, unless the attack deals piercing damage. A creature that has a flying or swimming speed or is acclimated to weightless environments, such as wildspace or the astral plane, might be immune to these effects."

Each creature has a Size Value based on its size; 1 (Tiny), 2 (Small), 4 (Medium), 8 (Large), 16 (Huge), 32 (Gargantuan). A mount can carry up to its own value in smaller creatures. Creatures grappled by the mount do not count towards this total.

For example, 4 Medium creatures in a cart totals 8, allowing a single Large horse to pull them. If multiple creatures are pulling the same vehicle, they can add their Size Values together to determine the total amount they can carry. For example, eight Medium creatures on a wagon totals 16, allowing two Large horses to pull them.",

Remember the purpose of Negotiation is not to change a person's ideals, but rather to convince them the request already aligns with them. Therefore, while charming effects might make certain arguments easier, it will not change the target's Motivations or Pitfalls, nor force the target to ignore them. More powerful magic that potentially could change Motivations or Pitfalls has likely left the realm of Negotiation and entered the realm of domination.",

However, this should be rare since, as mentioned above, subtler magics will not actively change the target's Motivations or Pitfalls, just make them more open to persuasion."
