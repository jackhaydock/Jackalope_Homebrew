					"Gaians are usually awakened fully mature and alone with no families of their own, save the bonds they make with other creatures. They tend to be more malleable within the first few weeks, able to subtly alter their form and learn rapidly. As such, they usually adopt the forms, languages and cultures of those they interact with shortly after being awakened. Most will typically settle into a more unchanging body and mind after a short while, finding it harder to change thereafter, as if they had been that way for many years.",
					"Gaians seem to come from almost any source of unliving minerals. From hot magma, freezing permafrost, precious gemstones or even mysterious metal ores found deep below the surface or in meteorites. Combined with their malleability in early days, this leads to a wide variety of appearances within gaians.",

The sands of Xheros and the woods of Xia have been known to spit out unusual phenomenon, perhaps gaians can be counted among them. Due to their rarity, knowledge of these people and the nature of their creation is limited. A few mages who are aware of them have become fascinated by them, and obsessed with trying to replicate their creation.",

While some creatures with this origin seek to end life that they find, some simply look to make their own way in the world. Gaians are another manifestation of magic: otherworldly lightning turning a rock to magma, powerful magic reversing the usual process and bringing life to a collection of sunshards, or ancient titanic spirits murmuring and bringing the world around them to life. While Gaians are not common, they hold a similar role to the Genasi of the world: elements given life, as opposed to life given elements. As such, they will find themselves accepted in any society. What is walking magma compared to dragons in the clouds, or eyes and whispers in the darkness?"
