Sometimes called royal aasimar or pure aasimar, these individuals use their allegedly stronger divinity to subtly bend the rules and expectations of reality.

This has, on occasion, led to assumptions about the parentage of bastards and has even allowed pretenders to challenge the royal dynasty, with little success however."

Creatures that can hear you within 10 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become charmed by you, or frightened if it is a fiend or undead, until the end of your next turn. Until the transformation ends, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra psychic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus."
