				"Hunting and tracking are useful skills to those who roam the wilds, but they are also useful to those who roam civilisation, only they usually track a different prey. Bounty hunters are specialists in hunting people, particularly those who don't want to be found. Unlike the quarry of more typical beast hunters, your quarry can be found in built cities as much as out in the wilds. One might assume the cobbled streets and dense foot traffic would make such tracking impossible, not so. It is simply a matter of adapting your tactics. Learn from the local population rather than trying to look past them. Understand the behaviours and movements of your prey. Plan your approach, then strike, and don't let them get away!",
				"Bounty Hunter is a term normally applied to those who hunt criminals or undesirables, usually for some reward from whatever passes for law in those parts. This could be a path you take, or you might instead take another that still necessitates the tracking of humanoids, such as a detective, a vigilante or even just a hobbyist people watcher."
