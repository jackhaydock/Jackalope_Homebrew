You are proficient with the shield, and you cannot be disarmed of it against your will.",

The shield then appears whenever you summon your pact shield thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient shield in this way. The shield ceases being your pact shield if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different shield, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The shield appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks."
