Even the gentler looking chasers sport impressive lupine maws, with fangs strong enough to hold all manner of prey. Deathhounds are often large imposing figures befiting their rumoured ties to the lands of the dead. With short dark fur covering lean frames and haunting eyes sometimes said to peer into one's very soul. Guides are often described with gentle and friendly appearances, with soft, light fur and expressive faces to fit their often warm personalities. Those of the sly variety are described with both hatred and admiration. Sleek and vulpine, they are often percieved as slippery, cunning and tricksy, but also charming. Watchdogs are known to be deeply inquisitive, with some suggesting their often wrinkled faces are the results of much quizical squinting. That or they are wrinkled by the stress of constantly being suspicious of every little detail. The most warrior-like fenri are often wardogs. Typically muscular brutes with sharp fangs and claw capable of tearing foes apart and frequently reveling in it. Such descriptions are stereotypical and there may be as many exceptions as there are conformers.",

Many, but not all, fenri there live tough lives as slaves or as nomadic outcasts, this is in part due to their connection to the prime god Kalibus, especially the deathounds. Kalibus is often vilified for his assumed role in the death of another prime god, Jutea. Unlike other prime gods, no surviving pharoh dynastry claims direct descendance from Kalibus. Often appearing among commoners, incarnations of Kalibus rarely have the power and influence afforded to pharohs to protect their people from persecution.",
							"Not too long ago, a great slave revolt and the resulting exodus of thousands of people from Xheros, many of them fenri, helped spread their numbers across Alvergia. Places such a Nekri in Cyranos and Frigan in the Northlands now house many of these refugees. This event is often referred to as the Fenri Exodus.",
