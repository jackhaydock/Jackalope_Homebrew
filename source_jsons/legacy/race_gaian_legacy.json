					"Gaians are usually awakened fully mature and alone with no families of their own, save the bonds they make with other creatures. They tend to be more malleable within the first few weeks, able to subtly alter their form and learn rapidly. As such, they usually adopt the forms, languages and cultures of those they interact with shortly after being awakened. No one is quite sure how they are awakened, though many suspect the whims of gods or nature spirits are often involved.",
