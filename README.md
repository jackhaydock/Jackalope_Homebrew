If you are using this homebrew as a DM for your own games, you can obviously ignore the above rulings and decide for yourself what to allow.

*NOTE: You can delete individual sources or items in the homebrew manager after importing if you wish. I recommend not deleting the Jackalope: General source as some other sources are dependent on it.*

## How to Import

1. Goto
https://5e.tools/managebrew.html

2. Click "Load from URL"
3. Copy/Paste this url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/Jackalope.json`
4. Done

You should then be able to see the sources and labels mentioned above, all the items will appear in their respective lists.

*NOTE: you will need to repeat this every time I update this, which I do frequently. I recommend deleting the old version before importing again as sometimes it bugs out and you'll get duplicate items.*
