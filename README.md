*NOTE: You can delete individual sources in the homebrew manager after importing, it is recommended that you do this for the sources that aren't relevant to you.*

## How to Import

1. Goto
https://5e.tools/managebrew.html

3. Click "Load from URL"
4. Copy/Paste this url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/Jackalope.json
5. Done

You should then be able to see the sources and labels mentioned above.

*NOTE: you will need to repeat this every time I update this, which I do frequently. I recommend deleting the old version before importing again as sometimes it bugs out and you'll get duplicate items*
