# Jackalope Homebrew
Homebrew collection for 5e.tools for my 5e campaign settings.

My items will have sources/labels, such as **Jackalope: General**/**J:General**. These represent which of my campaigns they are designed for and allowed in.

If you are using this homebrew as a DM for your own games, you can obviously ignore the above and decide for yourself what to allow.

*NOTE: You can delete individual sources or items in the homebrew manager after importing if you wish. I recommend not deleting the Jackalope: General source as some other sources are dependent on it.*

## How to Import
*NOTE: You will need to repeat this every time I update this, which I do frequently. I recommend deleting/overwriting the old version before importing again as sometimes it bugs out and you'll get duplicate items.*

#### 5eTools
1. Goto
https://5e.tools/managebrew.html

2. Click "Load from URL" and copy/paste this url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/Jackalope.json`
3. You should then see items in their respective lists.

*NOTE: Some class features (like fighting styles and pact boons), may not appear on the class pages, be sure to check the [optional features](https://5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html) page.*

#### Plutonium/Foundry
1. In foundry, when selecting a source for importing select "Custom URL" and paste this url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/Jackalope.json`

OR (as gamemaster)

1. Download/Clone the Jackalope.json file
2. In Foundry, open the Plutonium Config Editor and navigate to Import->Additional Homebrew Files
