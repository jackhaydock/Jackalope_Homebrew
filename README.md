## How to Import

#### 5eTools
1. Goto https://5e.tools/managebrew.html (or a mirror if you prefer)

2. Click "Load from URL" and copy/paste some or all of following URLs:
 - Main Collection (multiple sources of stuff generally allowed in my games): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/merged_jsons/jackalope_main.json`
 - Extra Collection (contains memes and character specific items): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/merged_jsons/jackalope_extra.json`
 - Legacy Collection (old stuff, not recommended): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/merged_jsons/jackalope_legacy.json`
 - Full Collection (all the above in one file): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/merged_jsons/jackalope_all.json`
 - You can also get the URLs to raw json files inside `source_jsons` if you want specific collections.
3. You should then see items in their respective lists.

In theory, you only need to import each URL once and then simply click Update in future to get any future changes, which I recommend doing frequently as I update this repo frequently.

*NOTE: Some class features (like fighting styles and pact boons), may not appear on the class pages, be sure to check the [optional features](https://5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html) page.*
