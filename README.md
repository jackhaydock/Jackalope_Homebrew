# TSoC_Homebrew
Homebrew collection for 5e.tools for my 5e campaign settings.

What each source/label means:
- **Jackalope: General**/**J:General**
  - Allowed in any of my campaigns unless stated otherwise.
- **Jackalope: The Magical Adventures of Lord Mayor Tin**/**J:Tin**
  - Meant for a specific character and are **not** allowed in any campaign unless stated otherwise.
- **Jackalope: The Sea of Cyranos**/**J:Cyranos**
  - Meant for the Sea of Cyranos campaign setting and **only** allowed in that setting unless stated otherwise.
- **Jackalope: The Skies of Caligos**/**J:Caligos**
  - Meant for the Skies of Caligos campaign setting and **only** allowed in that setting unless stated otherwise.

*NOTE: You can delete individual sources in the homebrew manager after importing, it is recommended that you do this for the sources that aren't relevant to you.*

## How to Import

1. Goto
https://5e.tools/managebrew.html

3. Click "Load from URL"
4. Copy/Paste this url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/TSoC_Homebrew/master/TSoC.json
5. Done

You should then be able to see the sources and labels mentioned above.

*NOTE: you will need to repeat this every time I update this, which I do frequently. I recommend deleting the old version before importing again as sometimes it bugs out and you'll get duplicate items*
