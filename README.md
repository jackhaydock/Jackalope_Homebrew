# Jackalope Homebrew
Homebrew collection for [5e.tools](https://5e.tools) for my 5e campaign settings.

My items will have sources/labels, such as **Jackalope: General**/**J:General**. These represent which of my campaigns they are designed for and allowed in.

If you are using this homebrew as a DM for your own games, you can obviously ignore the above and decide for yourself what to allow.

*NOTE: You can delete individual sources or items in the homebrew manager after importing if you wish.*

## How to Import

#### 5eTools
1. Goto https://5e.tools/managebrew.html (or a mirror if you prefer)

2. Click "Load from URL" and copy/paste some or all of following URLs:
 - General Collection: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/Jackalope.json`
 - Portalist Class: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/class_portalist.json`
 - Legacy Portalist Class (Not Recommended): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew/master/class_portalist_legacy.json`
3. You should then see items in their respective lists.

In theory, you only need to import each URL once and then simply click Update in future to get any future changes, which I recommend doing frequently as I update this repo frequently.

*NOTE: Some class features (like fighting styles and pact boons), may not appear on the class pages, be sure to check the [optional features](https://5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html) page.*

#### Plutonium/Foundry
1. In foundry, when selecting a source for importing select "Custom URL" and paste the URLs above.

OR (as gamemaster)

2. In Foundry, open the Plutonium Config Editor and navigate to Import->Additional Homebrew Files.
3. Enter the path to the json file(s).
4. When selecting sources to import you, and your players, should see a sources (usually alongside a blue tankard icon), select them and you'll see the items.
