Unlike other prime gods, Kalibus does not appears to have ties to any specific dynasty of pharohs, with their incarnations typically appearing among commoners. This distrust and lack of support from established monarchy has led to persecution of fenri, especially in areas controlled by the dynasties. At one time there was a mass breakout of slaves, mostly fenri, in north western Xheros. Many of these slaves then made their made west across the desert in Cyranos and the Northlands. Some settled in places such as Nekri and Frigan, others continued to spread across Alvergia. This event is sometimes called the Fenri Exodus.",

The sands of Xheros and the woods of Xia have been known to spit out unusual phenomenon, perhaps gaians can be counted among them.

Some of these aasimar, most notably the royal family, will claim a much richer source of celestial energy within their lineage. Sometimes called royal aasimar or pure aasimar, these individuals use their allegedly stronger divinity to subtly bend the rules and expectations of reality. This challenging of reality has become an steadfast tradition in the royal family, with each generation attempting more and more seemingly impossible feats of art, culture and engineering, even if not always directly.",

While extremely rare, even the simplest commoner might unexpectedly develop powers normally believed to be reserved for kings and queens. This has, on occasion, led to assumptions about the parentage of bastards and has even allowed pretenders to challenge the royal dynasty, with little success however."
